              Yes, your vehicle can be exempt from an MOT test if and only if it
              is not older than 3 years old. Most vehicles require a mot test
              after 3 years of purchase date. However, battery-powered vehicles
              are also exempted from the MOT test. Some other vehicles like
              tractors and classic vehicles over the age of 40 years are also
              exempted.

              been repaired and passed a retest. If you are caught driving
              without a valid mot, you will get fined.
